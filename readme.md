# **Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course: Full Repository**

This repository contains code implementations, notes, and additional resources for the Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course. The course offers a comprehensive dive into foundational and advanced topics in computer vision, deep learning, and generative models. Each directory corresponds to a specific set of lectures and topics covered throughout the course.

## Course Content Overview:

The directories are organized as follows:

### Introduction to Deep Learning
Covers the fundamentals of deep learning, including neural network architectures, training methodologies, and basic optimization techniques.

### Introduction to Pretraining and Augmentation
Explores the importance of pretraining and data augmentation in improving model performance, with practical examples of commonly used techniques.
### Computer Vision
Provides an overview of essential computer vision concepts, including image classification, convolutional networks, and feature extraction.
### Object Detection
Focuses on object detection models and techniques, covering popular architectures such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN for detecting objects within images.
### Semantic Segmentation
Delves into semantic segmentation methods, such as U-Net and FCN, to classify each pixel in an image into predefined categories.
### Generative Models
Discusses advanced generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with code to illustrate key concepts.
### Sequence Modeling
Covers sequence modeling and recurrent architectures, including LSTMs and Transformers, and their applications in vision and sequence data processing.
