# Modern Computer Vision: Generative Models Topics

This repository contains code implementations for topics covered in Lectures 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course. These lectures focus on advanced concepts in computer vision, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Advanced GAN techniques, and Diffusion Models.

## **Contents:**

The directory is organized by topic as follows:

### **1- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
Code implementation of VAEs, including network architecture, loss function, and training loop.
Example applications and reconstructions.

### **2- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
Basic GAN implementation, covering generator and discriminator design.
Code for training GANs with sample outputs for various data distributions.

### **3- Advanced GANs**
Implementation of advanced GAN techniques such as Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and WGAN-GP.
Code to experiment with different loss functions and architectures.

### **4- Diffusion Models**
Introduction to diffusion-based models for image generation.
Code demonstrating the forward and reverse diffusion process and training of a basic diffusion model.

## **Prerequisites:**

To run the code in this directory, you'll need the following Python libraries:

* torch
* torchvision
* numpy
* matplotlib


## **About the Course:**

This code is based on content from the Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course. For a deeper understanding of each concept and theoretical background, check out the full lecture series here on YouTube.
