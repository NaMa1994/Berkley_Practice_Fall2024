# Image Pretraining Practice Repository

This repository contains Python scripts I developed for my own practice in pre-training Transformer-based vision models (like ViT and Swin Transformer) on custom datasets. These scripts allow for pretraining on various configurations and, once trained, the model weights can be loaded into an AutoModelForImageClassification. Currently, the repository includes examples for:

* SimMIM (by Microsoft Research)
* MAE (by Facebook AI)

I created this setup to explore and experiment with image pretraining techniques firsthand.
