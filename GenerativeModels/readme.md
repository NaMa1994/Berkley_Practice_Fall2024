# Modern Computer Vision: Generative Models Topics

This repository contains code implementations for topics covered in Lectures 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the [Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=687zEGODmHA&list=PLzWRmD0Vi2KVsrCqA4VnztE4t71KnTnP5&index=12) on YouTube.
. These lectures focus on advanced concepts in computer vision, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Advanced GAN techniques, and Diffusion Models.

## **Contents:**

The directory is organized by topic as follows:

### **1- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
Code implementation of Autoencoder and VAEs, including network architecture, loss function, and training loop.
Example applications and reconstructions.

### **2- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
Basic GAN implementation, covering generator and discriminator design.
Code for training GANs with sample outputs for various data distributions.

### **3- Advanced GANs**
Implementation of advanced GAN techniques such as style GAN and Cycle GAN.
Code to experiment with different loss functions and architectures.

### **4- Diffusion Models**
Introduction to diffusion-based models for image generation.
Code demonstrating the forward and reverse diffusion process and training of a basic diffusion model.

## **Prerequisites:**

To run the code in this directory, you'll need the following Python libraries:

* torch
* torchvision
* numpy
* matplotlib


## **About the Course:**

This code is based on content from the Berkeley Modern Computer Vision Course. For a deeper understanding of each concept and theoretical background, check out the full lecture series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=687zEGODmHA&list=PLzWRmD0Vi2KVsrCqA4VnztE4t71KnTnP5&index=12) on YouTube.
